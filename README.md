## Introduction

In this course, I will be learning various AI and Machine Learning concepts, including but not limited to:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning

Throughout this repository, you will find different exercises, projects, and experiments that demonstrate my understanding of each topic.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. **Introduction to AI/ML**  
   - Basics of AI and ML
   - Overview of machine learning algorithms

2. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Regression techniques
   - Classification techniques

3. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction

4. **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**  
   - Artificial neural networks
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Text processing
   - Sentiment analysis

6. **Computer Vision**  
   - Image classification
   - Object detection

7. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Markov Decision Processes
   - Q-Learning

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on during the course:

- **Project 1: Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression**
  - A simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, etc.
  
- **Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**
  - A natural language processing project where a sentiment analysis model was built to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

- **Project 3: Image Classification with CNNs**
  - A project using convolutional neural networks to classify images from a dataset.

You can find the code for each of these projects in their respective folders.
